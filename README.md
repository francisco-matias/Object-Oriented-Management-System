# Object-Oriented-Management-System
Java Application - Advanced OOP Project

# Overview

This project consists of the development of a modular object-oriented management system implemented in Java. The application models a structured domain using well-defined class hierarchies and enforces strict business rules through encapsulation, controlled state transitions, and custom exception handling. The goal was to design a maintainable and extensible system architecture following solid object-oriented design principles.

# Features

- Hierarchical domain modelling
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Custom exception handling
- Persistent state management
- Separation between core logic and user interface

# Architeture

The system is organized into:

 - Core layer: Domain model and business logic
 - UI layer: Command-based user interaction
 - Persistence layer: Data serialization and state recovery

This separation ensures modularity, maintainability and extensibility.
